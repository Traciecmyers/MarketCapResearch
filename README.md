Market capitalization is just a fancy name for a straightforward concept: it is the market value of a company's outstanding shares. This figure is found by taking the stock price and multiplying it by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if Cory's Tequila Corporation (CTC) was trading at $20 per share and had a million shares outstanding, then the market capitalization would be $20 million ($20 x 1 million shares). It's that simple.

Outstanding shares refer to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders. Outstanding shares are shown on a company’s balance sheet under the heading “Capital Stock.” The number of outstanding shares is used in calculating key metrics such as a company’s market capitalization, as well as its earnings per share(EPS) and cash flow per share (CFPS).

According to Coin Market Cap

Market Capitalization is one way to rank the relative size of a cryptocurrency. It's calculated by multiplying the Price by the Circulating Supply.
Market Cap = Price X Circulating Supply.
Price is calculated by taking the volume weighted average of all prices reported at each market. Sources for the prices can be found on the markets section on each cryptocurrency page. For example, Bitcoin's markets.
What is the difference between "Circulating Supply", "Total Supply", and "Max Supply"?
Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.
Total Supply is the total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).
Max Supply is the best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency.
Why is the Circulating Supply used in determining the market capitalization instead of Total Supply?
We've found that Circulating Supply is a much better metric for determining the market capitalization. Coins that are locked, reserved, or not able to be sold on the public market are coins that can't affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well. The method of using the Circulating Supply is analogous to the method of using public float for determining the market capitalization of companies in traditional investing.

According to Coin Central
https://coincentral.com/cryptocurrency-market-capitalization/
Market capitalization (market cap) simply defines the current share price multiplied by the total number of existing shares. In cryptocurrency terms, this means the current price of a coin times the total number of coins in the market, often referred to as circulating supply.
Company Market Cap = Total Existing Shares * Current Price
Cryptocurrency Market Cap = Total Current Coins * Current Price

Token Stability
Running a master node requires collateral to be locked, reducing the circulating supply of that token available on the open market.
Due to the ongoing incentive of running master nodes to earn block rewards, investors are more likely to hold onto their tokens.
This, in theory, provides more price stability, which is important in a volatile asset class. Additionally, this structure is more likely to attract long-term investors rather than pump and dump groups.

Thoughts
We could contact exchanges to find out where they are getting their numbers from. If they are pulling the data from a central source, which would make sense, or if they are relying on each project to supply the circulating supply amount, total supply, and max supply on their tokens. 

Chris Jenkins is going to try to reach out to his Reddit community to get an answer. I will also reach out to someone who has had a coin listed and see if they know. Will keep all posted
